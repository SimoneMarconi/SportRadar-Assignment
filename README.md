# Sportradar Assignment

## Overview
This project implements a full-stack web application using different technologies for the frontend and backend, containerized with Docker for a consistent and reliable deployment environment.

### Backend
The backend is developed in **Python 3** using **Flask** as a lightweight REST API framework and **SQLite3** as the database.  
It handles data management, validation, and API communication with the frontend.

### Frontend
The frontend is built with **TypeScript** and **React**, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.  
This setup ensures fast rendering and a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimoneMarconi/SportRadar-Assignment
cd SportRadar-Assignment
```

### 2. Run with Docker (Recommended)
The easiest and most reliable way to run the application is via Docker.
Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed, then run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
``` 
This command builds and starts both the frontend and backend containers.
Once started, the application will be available at:
http://localhost:80

### 3. Run Manually (Without Docker)
If you prefer to run the application manually:

**Backend Setup**
``` bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app app run
```

**Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
or, if you use pnpm:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Assumptions
- Leaderboard Points System: Each team receives 1 point for a win or a draw, and 0 points for a loss. This point system applies equally to all sports within the application.
- Match Creation Requirements: When inserting a new match, the provided team names and location must already exist in the database.
